# ML-Model-Titanic-Survival-Prediction
we need to build a predictive model that answers the question: what sorts of people were more likely to survive?

**Problem Statement** : The sinking of the Titanic is one of the most infamous shipwrecks in history.

In this challenge, we need to build a predictive model that answers the question: “what sorts of people were more likely to survive?” using passenger data (ie name, age, gender, socio-economic class, etc).

### Work Flow
1. Get Data
2. Data Pre Processing
3. Data Analysis
4. Train Test Split(But given dataset is already splitted)
5. Logistic Regression Model
6. Evaluation
